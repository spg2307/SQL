Monthly Percentage Difference
Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. 
The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, 
rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and can be calculated as ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.

-- Use the lag function for calculating month over month difference from previous month
-- Question is mentioned hard due to the formatting that needs to be done as part of the solution


with cte as (
select to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-mm') my, round(sum(value)::numeric, 2) tot
from sf_transactions
group by to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-mm')
order by to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-mm')
)
select my, round((tot/(lag(tot,1) OVER (ORDER BY my asc))*100)-100::numeric,2) from cte
