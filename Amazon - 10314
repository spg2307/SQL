Revenue Over Time
Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased. Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values. Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month. A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months. The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average since we are not given data from last year. Assume each month has at least one purchase.
